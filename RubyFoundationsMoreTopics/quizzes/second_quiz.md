## Second Quiz Introduction To Testing

Question 1 1 / 1 Points Correct
A primary reason for writing tests is regression testing. What do we mean by regression tests, and why are they useful?

Your Answer
A
Regression tests check the integration between small pieces (or units) of code with the wider code base. They help ensure that the integration between units works.

B
Regression tests check for bugs that occur in formerly working code after you make changes somewhere in the codebase. Using tests to identify these bugs means we don't have to verify that everything works manually after each change.

C
Regression tests check the specific functionality of a small piece (or unit) of code. They test that unit in isolation to ensure it works.

D
Regression tests check new features that we add to a program to determine whether they work.

A verification step to confirm that the results returned by a program or application match the expected results.

A situation or context in which verification checks are made. For example, making sure you get an error message after trying to log in with the wrong password. May require multiple steps.
