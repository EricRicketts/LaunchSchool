  1.  Write a program that takes a group of integers from 1 to a 1000 at the most and counts the number of odd numbers that are not prime
  2.  solve(['abode', 'ABc', 'xyzD']) => [4, 3, 1] Consider the word 'abode'.  We can see that 'a' is in position 1 and that 'b' is in
  position 2.  In the alphabet 'a' and 'b' are in positions 1 and 2.  Notice also that 'd' and 'e' in 'abode' occupy the same positions
  as they would in the alphabet, that is positions 4 and 5.  You program should count, for each string in the array of strings how
  many letters are in their proper alphabet position.
