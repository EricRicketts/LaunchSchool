### Formal Pseudo Code Lesson Two

1.  A Method That Returns The Sum Of Two Integers
  1.  START
  2.  GET the first of two numbers from the user
  3.  SET the input to NUMBER1 after converting it to an integer
  4.  GET teh second of two numbers from the user
  5.  SET the iput to NUMBER2 after converting it to an integer
  6.  RETURN NUUMBER1 + NUMBER2

2.  A Method That Takes An Array Of Strings And Returns A String That Is All Of Those Strings Concatenated Together
  1.  START we are given an array of Strings
  2.  GET the first element of the array, which is a string
  3.  GET the next element of the array which is another string
  4.  SET a new string which is the concatenation of the first two strings
  5.  GET the next string in the array and concatenate it onto the string in STEP 4
  6.  REPEAT this process to the last element in the Array
  7.  RETURN concatenated final string

3.  A Method That Takes An Array Of Integers And Returns A New Array Of Every Other Element
  1.  START we are given an array of integers
  2.  ITERATE through the array selecting every odd index
  3.  RETURN the newly composed array
