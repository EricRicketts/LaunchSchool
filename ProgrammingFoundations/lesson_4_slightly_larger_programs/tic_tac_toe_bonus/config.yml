    Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!!
    You will be playing the computer.
  Instructions: |
    You will choose whether to be X's or O's.
    You will move first, followed by the computer.
    The board will be updated and shown after each move.

    diagonal wins the game.  If all the squares are
    occupied with no three of a kind in a row, then the game is a tie.

    A board with numbered squares is shown below.
    To move enter a number representing an unoccupied square.
