If we have a Car class and a Truck class and we want to be able to go_fast,
how can we add the ability for them to go_fast using the module Speed?
How can you check if your Car or Truck can now go fast?

module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

class Truck
  def go_very_slow
    puts "I am a heavy truck and like going very slow."
  end
end
=end

module Speed
  def go_fast
    "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  include Speed
  def go_slow
    "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

class Truck
  include Speed
  def go_very_slow
    "I am a heavy truck and like going very slow."
  end
end

class QuestionTwoTest < Minitest::Test

  def test_1
    expected = "I am a Car and going super fast!"
    assert_equal(expected, Car.new.go_fast)
  end

  def test_2
    expected = "I am a Truck and going super fast!"
    assert_equal(expected, Truck.new.go_fast)
  end
end
