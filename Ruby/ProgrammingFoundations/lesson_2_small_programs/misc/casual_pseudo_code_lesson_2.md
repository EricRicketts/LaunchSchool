### Casual Pseudo Code For Lesson Two

1.  A method that returns the sum of two integers
  1.  Ask for the first integer
  2.  Get the input and convert it to an integer
  3.  Ask for the second integer
  4.  Get the input and convert it to an integer
  5.  Add the two integers

2.  A method that takes an array of strings and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
  1.  We start with the array of strings as that is given
  2.  We iterate through the array and join the previous string with the current string
  3.  Once the array is done iterating through each element we return the newly composed string

3.  A method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with every other element
  1.  We start with an array of integers as that is given
  2.  We iterate through the array, collecting the elements with odd indices
  3.  We return the new array
