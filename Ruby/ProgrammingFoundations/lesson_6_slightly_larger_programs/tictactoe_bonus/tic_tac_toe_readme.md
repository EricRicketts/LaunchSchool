## Launch School Course 101: Programming Foundations Lesson 6: Slightly Larger Programs Assignment 7: Tic Tac Toe Bonus Features

### Running The Program

1.  From the _app_ directory run __ruby tic_tac_toe_bonus.rb__.
2.  From one directory above the _app_ directory run __ruby app/tic_tac_toe_bonus.rb__.

### Running The Tests

1.  To run all of the tests from one directory above the _app_ directory run __rake test__.
2.  To run an individual test, from one directory above the _app_ directory run __rake test TEST=test/test_file.rb__.
3.  The _minitest_ gem needs to be installed.

### Running Rubocop

1.  The _.rubocop.yml_ file is configured for the latest version of Rubocop, not the Launch School suggested version.
2.  To lint all files, run _rubocop_ from the directory above the _app_ directory, with the following command __rubocop app/*.rb__.
3.  To lint a single file, run _rubocop_ from the directory above the _app_ directory, with the following command __rubocop app/file.rb__.

### Program Organization

1.  Features implemented
	1.  Improved "join".
	2.  Keep score.
	3.  Improve game loop.
	4.  I did not seek AI enhancements as that is set aside for the object orientated version.
