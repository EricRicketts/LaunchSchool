## Pratice Ideas for 109 Assessment

### Programming Ideas
1.  Learn what combinations are and write a method which reproduces the Array#combination
2.  Learn what permutations are and write a method which reproduces the Array#permutation
3.  Write a method which produces the substrings for a given string and the user can specify
the minimum length of each substring, default to 1 character
4.  Write a method which produces the substrings for a given string and the user can specify
the substring length
5.  Primes
	1.  Write a method which generates the first n primes
	2.  Write a method which generates all of the primes up to a certain number
	3.  Write a method which checks to see if a number is a prime number
	4.  Write a method which performs the prime factorization of a number, but
	stores the factorization in the format [prime_number, number_of_appearances],
	so the prime factorization of 12 = 2*2*3 or [[2, 2], [3, 1]]
6.  Numbers
	1.  Write a method which produces the Greatest Common Divisor between two numbers
	2.  Write a method which produces the Least Common Multiple between two numbers
	3.  Write a method which produces the nth Fibonacci number, do not do it with recursion

### Code Reading Ideas
1.  Go through Lesson 3 and do all the code reading problems again
2.  Go through any of the code reading sections on the quizzes

```ruby
# describe what this code does
# line by line
class A
  def val
    10
  end

  def test
    back = []
    x = val
    back << x
    val = x + 1
    back << val
    x = val
    back << x
  end
end

p A.new.test

# what does this code print
# out and why?
class B
  def val
    10
  end

  def test
    val = val
  end
end

p B.new.test
```
