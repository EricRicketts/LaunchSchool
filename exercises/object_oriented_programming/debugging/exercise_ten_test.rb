The SearchEngine indeed raises an AuthenticationError, but it never reaches the DoesItRock::find_out method, because
Score::for_term already catches it, resulting in the return value NoScore.

But if the return value is NoScore, why does the find_out method not print the message "No idea about #{term}..."?
In order to see this, recall how case statements work. The value of score will be compared with each value in the
when clauses using the === operator. In case of the first when clause, the comparison is NoScore === score, and
since the left-hand side is a class, its implementation boils down to checking whether score is_a? NoScore. This yields
false when score has the value NoScore, as it is not an instance of the NoScore class. As a result, we end up with the value of the else clause.

In order to fix this, Score::for_term has to return an instance of the NoScore class (i.e. NoScore.new), instead of the name of the class itself.

Now, back to the original problem: if the API key is wrong, we want the AuthenticationError to reach the find_out method.
One way to achieve this is to simply remove the rescue clause in Score::for_term. But this would also prevent us from
rescuing other exceptions, like a possible ZeroDivisionError, which arguably is a perfect occasion to return no score.
In order to solve this, we decide to rescue only that specific exception within Score::for_term and let all others through.

With those changes, the code runs as expected. However, there is still one thing wrong about our code, which is less obvious.
And that's the use of Exception.

Exception is the top-most class in Ruby's exception hierarchy and it seems a straightforward choice to rescue or inherit from.
But it's too broad. When creating custom exceptions and when rescuing exceptions, it's good practice to always use the subclass
StandardError. StandardError subsumes all application-level errors. The other descendants of Exception are used for system- or
environment-level errors, like memory overflows or program interruptions. These are the kind of errors your application usually
does not want to throw - and definitely does not want to rescue, they should be handled by Ruby itself.
