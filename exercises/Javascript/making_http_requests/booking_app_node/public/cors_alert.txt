Remember when running all of the html an javascript code below, you must server the files from the express based
node server.  So for example if you want to run exercise_one.html, then start the application => npm start since
the port number for local host is 3000 you need to load the html through via the server, so in your browser
navigate to http://localhost:3000/exercise_one.html and this will solve the CORS issues.  If you just load the file
then the javascript will fail because of the CORS violation.
