I need to show a list of dates, these dates are the one which currently have bookings.  A booking is defined as
a schedule which is assigned, i.e., it has a non-null values associated with the student_email key.  The second
level of display is optional.  The user clicks on the date and booking information is shown for that date, which
is the name of the staff, the student email and the time.

1.  If I send a GET request to /api/schedules I get all of the schedules.
2.  I then need to filter out all of the schedules that have bookings, in this case it is where the
student_email key is non-null.
3.  I then need to make a request to api/staff_members so that I have access to all staff_ids and their names
4.  I then need to create a new data structure which would be an array of objects:
{
    date_0: [{staff_name, student_email, time}, {staff_name, student_email, time}, ...],
    date_1: [same as above]
}
5.  Once I do this I cycle through the object:
    create a new list item with the date as the text
    create a new unordered list
    for each object create a new list item for the unordered list which contains the following text
    staff_name | student_email | time

Creating the data structure:
use reduce to cycle through the schedules filtered schedules data
1.  has the current date already been seen?
    1.  If so then push the data onto the array for that date that data will be on object form.
    2.  If not use the date as a new key and push the data into object form as the value for the date key
    3.  If time sort the keys.
