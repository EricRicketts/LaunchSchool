First sketch out the forms:

Legend --Schedules--
Please Select One Schedule: select tag => staff_name | date | time
Email: input[type="text"] tag (for student email)
input[type="submit"]

Optional Form
Legend --Please Provide New Student Details--
Email: input[type="text"] tag (for student email)
Name: input[type="text"] tag (for student name)
Booking Sequence: input[type="text"] this we should get from the Student Not Found Error Response
input[type="submit"]

Algorithm

Populating the select tag
1.  Do a GET Request on api/schedules, which returns an array of objects.
2.  Filter the response, selecting those which have student_email as null
3.  Once I get the schedules I have to get all of the staff members api/staff_members
4.  Now I have to use the staff_id of the filtered schedules to get the name of the staff members
3.  When populating the select tag for the first form, the value for each option will be the
schedule id.
4.  If I have time I can try to sort the option fields by staff id first then within staff_id sort by date
and finally by time.

Submitting the first form
1.  Do an addEventListener('submit') on the submit button of the form.
2.  event.preventDefault()
3.  If the response status is 204, then alert => "Booked"
5.  Then populate the select tag with the new booking information
6.  If the student does not exist in the database then a 404 will return and the message will contain the
booking_sequence, grab the booking_sequence from the response.
7.  So the above response should be an error and we can have an event listener for the error, in which case we
have to bring up the new form.
8.  The new form should be pre-populated with the new student email and booking_sequence.
9.  The student should fill in his name
10. Once the new student form is submitted, then the booking form should also be submitted but after the
server has verified that the student is now valid.
11. If there is an error in submitting this new student form, an alert error should be shown.
12. If there is no error, then the first alert should be the responseText from the new student form
and then 'Booked' from the booking form submission.
