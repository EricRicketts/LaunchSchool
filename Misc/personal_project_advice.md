## Advice From Chris Lee On Personal Projects

1.  Personal Project Guidance
    *  Subscriptions can be stopped at any time, if you decide to re-activate you can resume where you left off.
    *  Do not ask for code review of personal projects.
    *  Be careful about what type of project you attempt. Typically, the advice is plan a project, then chop the scope in half.
       Then chop it in half again. There's almost no such thing as "too simple" of a practice project. People tend to overestimate
       their ability and chew off too much (coming up with ideas/features is fun and easy). The other problem is that people are
       not very good at coming up with useful projects to build. Usually, they challenge people in the wrong directions, or require
       concepts not yet covered.
    *  Do not get tempted to build features, which will cause you to use libraries or gems you are not familiar with.  That defeats
       the purpose of practice.  Build everything _from scratch_ as you have learned at Launch School.
