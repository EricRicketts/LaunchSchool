  <h1>Lincoln's Gettysburg Address</h1>
  <p>
    Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
    continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
    proposition that all men are created equal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
    or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
    met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a
    portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave
    their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
    proper that we should do this.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we
    can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
    struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
    detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say
    here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the
    living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they
    who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
    to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from
    these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
    they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly
    resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation,
    under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of
    the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
    earth.

<!-- I would say a section or an article, but I guess I would go
with a section because this address is a sematic group of content.

Launch School said it would be an article because it is self-contained
and resusable.

<!--
3.  Given the HTML from question 2, would it be appropriate to replace
<sometag> with <address> or <blockquote>? If so, which one?

It would be a <blockquote> because that element is used to indicate
an extended quotation.  The h1 and p elements could still be included
in the blockquote.

I agree with the Launch School comment, replace <sometag> with a
<blockquote> and then wrap everything in an <article>.  The <address>
element would not be appropriate as it is used for contact information.

  <h3>Text-align Property</h3>
  <p>
    Given the width of the paragraph, the heading looks odd hanging out on
    the left side of the screen. Let's center it instead; we'll do this
    with the text-align property:
  <p>

  <pre>
    <h1 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Hello, Internet!</h1>
  </pre>
</sometag>
<!--
I would use a <section> in place of <sometag>.  The reason being all of
this content is related to aligning text, all of the elements need to
be grouped together for them to collectively have meaning.

<h3>Hex Colors</h3>

<p>
  Most graphics and design applications like Photoshop and Pixelmator
  display colors in hexadecimal format, so it's easy to copy and paste
  color values you need from one program into your editor as a CSS
  property.
</p>

<sometag>
  <p>
    If you're unfamiliar with the hexadecimal numbering system, it uses 16
    different digits instead of the ten the decimal system uses. The hex
    digits are 0 through 9, as in the decimal system, but also include a
    through f (or A through F) as valid digits.
  </p>
</sometag>
<!--
I would use an <aside> element as it is tangentially related to the
h3 and first paragraph.

The Launch School Solution agrees with my answer.
