      Problem 1:

      Create an HTML page with a single paragraph of text. Write CSS to set
      the font size for most elements on the page to 20px (you may ignore
      headers, subscripts, and other items that often have a different size).
    -->
    Problem 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a single paragraph of text and its font size will be
    20px.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to distinguish this paragraph from those that follow I
    am going to give it an id attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact all of the elements in
    the followign problems are going to have id attributes. 
  </p>

    <!--
    Problem 2:

    Change the font family for the page from the previous problem to a sans-serif font.
    -->
    Problem 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also another single paragraph and as with the first
    paragraph, the font size will be set to 20px.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now the font type
    will be sans-serif.
