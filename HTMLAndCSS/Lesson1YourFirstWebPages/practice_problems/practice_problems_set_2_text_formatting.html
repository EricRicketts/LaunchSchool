    <!--
      Problem 1:

      Create an HTML page with a single paragraph of text. Write CSS to set
      the font size for most elements on the page to 20px (you may ignore
      headers, subscripts, and other items that often have a different size).
    -->
    Problem 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a single paragraph of text and its font size will be
    20px.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to distinguish this paragraph from those that follow I
    am going to give it an id attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact all of the elements in
    the followign problems are going to have id attributes.
  </p>

  <p id="second-problem">
    <!--
    Problem 2:

    Change the font family for the page from the previous problem to a sans-serif font.
    -->
    Problem 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also another single paragraph and as with the first
    paragraph, the font size will be set to 20px.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now the font type
    will be sans-serif.
  </p>

  <p id="third-problem">
    <!--
    Problem 3:

    Change the CSS for the previous problem to give the browser a choice one of three fonts
    (Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Verdana), depending on what is available, before it uses the
    default sans-serif font.
    -->
    Problem 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;This paragraph is the same as paragraphs 1 and 2 but with
    additonal font options in the CSS.
  </p>

  <p id="fourth-problem">
    <!-- Problem 4: Change the text from the previous problem to italic. -->

    Problem 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same paragraph as problem 3 but with
    intalic text style.
  </p>

  <p id="fifth-problem">
    <!-- Problem 5: Change the CSS from the previous problem to boldface (keep the italics). -->
    Problem 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same as Problem 4 but now we have both italic font style and
    bold font weight.
  </p>

  <div id="sixth-problem">
    <!--
      Problem 6:

      Change the CSS from the previous problem to increase the line height to 2.5
      times its default height.
    -->
    <p>Problem 6, first paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not a paragraph in this problem but a &lt;div&gt;.</p>
    <p>Probelm 6, second paragrapah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we can see the affect of setting the line height to 2.5</p>
  </div>

  <div id="seventh-problem">
    <!--
      Problem 7:

      Change the CSS you wrote in questions 1-6 to a shorthand form that uses precisely one property.
      The output should not change.
    -->
    <p>Problem 7, first paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with Problem 6, we are not a paragraph in this problem but a &lt;div&gt;.</p>
    <p>Probelm 7, second paragrapah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same result as Problem 6 but with on line of CSS code.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="eighth-problem">
    <!--
      Problem 8:

      Change the CSS from the previous problem to right-align the text within the paragraph:
    -->
    <p>Problem 8, first paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with Problem 7, we are not a paragraph in this problem but a &lt;div&gt;.</p>
    <p>Probelm 8, second paragrapah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same result as Problem 7 but we are right aligning the text within the paragraph.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="ninth-problem">
    <!--
      Problem 9:

      Change the CSS from the previous problem to center-align the text within the paragraph:
    -->
    <p>Problem 9, first paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with Problem 8, we are not a paragraph in this problem but a &lt;div&gt;.</p>
    <p>
      Probelm 9, second paragrapah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same result as Problem 8 but we are center aligning the text within the paragraph.
      Note in all of these text alignment problems we can see how block level elements behave in that they take up all of the
      available width within the web page.  If they did not we would not see such a dramatic shift in the text position from
      problem 7 to problem 8 to problem 9.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="tenth-problem">
    <!--
      Problem 10:

      Change the CSS from the previous problem to fully justify the text within the paragraph:
    -->
    <p>Problem 10, first paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with Problem 9, we are not a paragraph in this problem but a &lt;div&gt;.</p>
    <p>
      Probelm 10, second paragrapah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same result as Problem 9 but we are justifying the text vice aligning it
      to a certain position.  I have to put in more text in this paragraph to make sure we can see the effects of justifying
      the paragraph.  I want to make sure there are enough characters to cause the justify property to take effect.  Since
      I expanded the browser to take up the entire workspace, I hope I have made this paragraph long enough.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="eleventh-problem">
    <!--
      Problem 11:

      Change the CSS from the previous problem to indent the start of the paragraph by 4em.
    -->
    <p>Problem 11, first paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with Problem 10, we are not a paragraph in this problem but a &lt;div&gt;.</p>
    <p>
      Probelm 11, second paragrapah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same result as Problem 9 but we are justifying the text vice aligning it
      to a certain position.  I have to put in more text in this paragraph to make sure we can see the effects of justifying
      the paragraph.  I want to make sure there are enough characters to cause the justify property to take effect.  Since
      I expanded the browser to take up the entire workspace, I hope I have made this paragraph long enough.  However, in this
      case we are also adding a paragraph indentation.
    </p>
