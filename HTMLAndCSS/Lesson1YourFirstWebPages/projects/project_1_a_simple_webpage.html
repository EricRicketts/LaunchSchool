  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to my website!&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a work in progress as I learn <span class="important-text"><strong>HTML</strong></span> and <span class="important-text"><strong>CSS</strong></span>
    from a <span class="emphasized-text"><em>terrific</em></span> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com/" title="Launch School">Launch School</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm learning a lot!&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don't you join me!
  </p>

  <p class="more-text">
    There's not a lot of material on this page as I am playing around with HTML &amp; CSS.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take
    on a lighter color than the first - the &quot;class&quot; attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
  </p>

  <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
    This is the final paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also uses a `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll use some some CSS and the
    `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
  </p>
