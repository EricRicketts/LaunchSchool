  /*
    in this case when I click on the inner div I get the following alert:
    inner outer 1 - this is the capture phase because the event handler on the outer div was activated during
    this capture phase, because stopPropagation was called in the makeRed event handler the target phase was
    never reached.  Now the inner div did turn red, but this is because the EventObject will always give one
    access to the target

    However, if I swap out the currentTarget for the target, then the inner div will never the changed to the color
    red.  This is because the event will never make it down to the inner div thus we will not have a case where
    the currentTarget is ever the inner div.  If I did not have stopPropagation then clicking on the inner div
    would yield two alerts (and target was toggled with makeRed not currentTarget):
    inner outer 1 - capture phase
    inner inner 2 - target phase

    in such a case the inner div would never turn red because makeRed would be called twice
