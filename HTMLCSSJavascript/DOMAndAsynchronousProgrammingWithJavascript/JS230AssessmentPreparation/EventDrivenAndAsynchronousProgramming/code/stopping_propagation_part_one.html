      I got some unusual behavior to begin with, when I clicked the inner div and it did not turn red.  When I
      opened the DevTools and set a breakpoint, I found it did turn red and then turned back to lightblue.  This was
      because the event handler was called twice for the inner div.

      I put in a debugging alert statement as shown above, when I clicked the inner div, I got the following two
      alerts:

      inner inner 2 - this was the target phase, both the target and the current target are the same element
      inner outer 3 - this was the bubble phase, the target is inner but the current target is outer, since
      an event listener was put on outer, the bubble phase forced this event listener to fire, in doing so it
      caused the makeRed event handler to be invoked again, thus causing the make-red class to be removed from
      the inner div, so the color reverted back to lightblue.

      However, when I clicked on the outer div I got the following alert:

      outer outer 2 - this was both the target phase, but since there are no events registered on any other elements
      higher up in the DOM tree, this was the only listener that fired, there is no other element to "bubble up" to.
      Thus the code behaved as I originally anticipated.
