  /*
    when clicking on the anchor tag we had the following response:
    1.  A A 2
    2.  A click event on the anchor tag
    3.  the link to google.com was followed

    when clicking on the button, we get the following response:
    1.  BUTTON A 1
    2.  A click on the anchor tag
    3.  BUTTON BUTTON 2
    4.  Following the link was prevented
    5.  google.com was never followed

    in the first case when we clicked on the anchor tag, we were in the target phase, so there was no
    propagation down to the button tag.  Thus the preventDefault method was never invoked, both alerts
    came up an the link was followed to google.

    to understand the second case is very important, the preventDefault method is called on the event object, not
    on the element to which the event listener was attached.  when clicking on the button, the browser waits for
    the event to go through all of the propagation phases before it performs the default action on the event.  If
    there is an event handler with a preventDefault invocation somewhere in the path, the default behavior is
    skipped.  In this case the target phase BUTTON BUTTON 2 invokes the preventDefault method and the link is not
    followed.
