1.  True or False: there is a direct one-to-one mapping between the tags
that appear in an HTML file and the nodes in the DOM.

There may not be a one to one mapping between the tags that appear in the HTML and the
Nodes in the DOM because of extra text nodes that might appear in the DOM.

As noted by Launch School the browser might insert additional nodes that do not appear in
the HTML due to invalid markup or omission of tags.

2.  True or False: Text nodes sometimes contain nothing but whitespace.

True, we might have whitespace between two different tags that appear on different lines
in the HTML.

Problems 3 and 4 were done in a notebook
